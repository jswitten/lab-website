The Witten Lab officially opens at Case Western Reserve University in the Department of Genetics & Genome Sciences. We are excited to begin building our research program at the intersection of artificial intelligence and gene therapy.

Our lab focuses on developing AI-driven approaches to design lipid nanoparticles for treating lung diseases. We combine computational methods with experimental validation to accelerate the development of next-generation gene therapies.

We are actively recruiting graduate students and postdocs to join our team. If you're interested in working at the intersection of machine learning and bioengineering, please visit our [Join](/join/) page for more information.
